This is the original code used Jason Detwiler for his study *Muon Beam Experiment MC (Dec 2011)*.

Original usage notes:

> I'm attaching a tarball. NeuProBLM is my name for the project (Neutron
> Production by BeamLine Muons, although in the files you will see the
> acronym MBNM for Muon Beam Neutron Measurement for when I didn't have
> a name for it). You will find two subdirectories, one containing the
> big simulations I ran on Carver a while back (including all the job
> scripts and analysis code), and one containing some minor changes to
> investigate a few things back in last November. In each case, the
> simulation is all in one file. I suggest you read through that file
> and the accompanying macros and see if you can figure out what is
> going on. I hope I left it in a running state but I can't remember
> right now. Anyway, assuming I did, I recommend getting it
> up-and-running in G4.9.6 and use the Shielding physics list with the
> TENDL data libraries, then modifying it as necessary. Feel free to
> contact me as questions arise.

This is a repository for the CERN muon beam experiment simulation code.

These are the modules:

* **prelim_g4.9.4** Simulation code from _Muon Beam Experiment MC_ (Detwiler, Dec 2011).  
* **prelim_g4.9.6** Same as above, but reworked for G4.9.6. Now compiles on G4.10. 
* **beam_test_g4** Simulation code for the late 2012 test (G4.9.6).
* **nuSinct** Preliminary code for neutron detector efficiency studies.
